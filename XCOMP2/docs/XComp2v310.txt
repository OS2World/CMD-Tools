        Long Description: XComp/2 is a multithreaded recursive file comparison
                          tool (as a counterpart to XCOPY) that is especially
                          useful to compare CDs burned with the original data.
                          Support for CRC32 and MD5 Checksums is included.
                          Source (and WIN32 port) is included (req. IBM 
                          VisualAge C++ V3.6.5, Warp Toolkit or compatible).

                          Also part of that package is IsoComp/2, a utility 
                          to compare with or convert to CD-ROMs into ISO or 
                          RAW image or RSJ track image files, also supporting 
                          CRC32 and MD5 checksums. Complete Source (and WIN32 
                          port) is included.
