Use the ISOCOMP command to compare the contents of a Source CD-ROM with the
contents of a Target CD-ROM or with an ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file.
Or you can create an ISO image or RSJ track image file out of a CD-ROM.

Syntax:
  ISOCOMP Source(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
        Target(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
        [/!MP] [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]] [/P] [/TINY]
        [/CHK:drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
  ISOCOMP CDROM-drive: | CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file
        [/!MP] [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]] [/P] [/TINY]
        [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
Where:
  Source(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
                 Specifies either the Source drive letter (e.g. Z or Z:) of
                 your CD-ROM drive containing a data CD-ROM, or the location
                 and name of a Source ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file, whose
                 contents you want to compare with a media in your Target
                 CD-ROM drive or to compare it with or write from an ISO image
                 or RSJ track image file.
                 You may specify a fully qualified path or UNC path.
  Target(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
                 Specifies either the Target drive letter (e.g. Z or Z:) of
                 your CD-ROM drive containing a data CD-ROM, or the location
                 and name of a Target ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file. If
                 the image file does not exist, it will be created out of the
                 CD-ROM contents, otherwise compared with the CD-ROM contents
                 (Only ISO or RSJ track image files will be created).
                 You may specify a fully qualified path or UNC path.
  [/!MP]
                 Specifies that only 1 thread is used reading the CD-ROM
                 contents and the image file instead of the default of 2
                 threads.
  [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]]
                 Specifies that ISOCOMP/2 logs all problems into a file
                 specified either by this parameter, or by the ISOCOMP
                 environment variable or into ISOCOMP.LOG (put into the
                 directory ISOCOMP/2 was installed into) otherwise.
  [/P]
                 Request ISOCOMP/2 to pause when it has finished.
  [/TINY]
                 2 64kB buffers are used instead of a percentage of total RAM.
  [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
                 Specifies that ISOCOMP/2 uses a checksum file to ensure data
                 integrity. If the checksum file does not exist, it will be
                 created, otherwise compared with the checksum calculated
                 from the data read from the Source.
Returns:
  0              Successful completion
  100+           Fatal, unrecoverable exceptions

<p>
Well, above explanation should be self explanatory.
ISOCOMP/2 assumes that an ISO image file (2048 Bytes/Sector) has been specified
unless a file has the extensions:
<ol>
<li><b>.RAW</b> or <b>.BIN</b>, in that case it will assume that a RAW image file
(2352 Bytes/Sector) has been specified.
If those extensions are not give, ISOCOMP/2 tries to determine the format from
the file size (that is, if the file contains a non-fractional number of RAW 
sectors and only a fractional number of ISO sectors, the file is assumed to be
in RAW format)
<br>
Note, that RAW image files can only be read not written, and ISOCOMP/2 only
uses the ISO data within it (for comparing or checksum calculation).
<li><b>.RSJ</b> or <b>.TRK</b>, in that case it will assume that a RSJ track 
image file has been specified.
</ol>
As the format of a RSJ track image file is not published, I had to do some
reverse engineering which currently works, but there is no guarantee that
RSJ won't change it.
ISOCOMP/2 of course validates the signature in an RSJ track image to be
sure it really is a RSJ track image file.
<p>
There are basically 2 variations for the commandline:
<ul>
<li>The first which allows you to
create a Target ISO image or RSJ track image file out of the contents of a
Source CD-ROM data media or ISO image or RSJ track image file.
You therefore have to specify the location of the Source and Target data.
<li>The second allows you either to compare the CRC32 and MD5 checksums of the 
contents of a CD-ROM data media or ISO or RAW image or RSJ track image file or
to calculate the CRC32 and MD5 checksums.
Thus you only need to specify the location of the Source data then.
</ul>
Just to avoid any misunderstanding, you can compare the contents of medias
in a Source and Target CD-ROM drive, but of course ISOCOMP/2 can't write
onto a Target CD-ROM only into a target image (ISO or RSJ) file.
<p>
A sample run to compare the contents of a CD-ROM media with the ISO image file
it was burnt from may output (though we are comparing ISO images, we refer
to it as being a file, because OS/2 treats them that way):

</xmp>
<font Face="Helv,Helvetica,Arial">
<p>
One note about the line containing the <b>Throughput</b> measurements.
Above example shows about 607kB/s throughput on the <b>Source</b> CD-ROM
drive, which says the CD-ROM is performing at a speed of about 4x (a
througput of 150kB/s is rated as 1x speed).
4x seems to be a little bit low for today's CD-ROM drives, but the 
media used was a CD-RW media, and writeable or especially rewriteable medias tend
to be much slower than mastered CD medias, for both reading and burning (for factory
mastered medias you should get the top performance of your drive)!
<p>
The performance given for <b>Source</b> and <b>Destination</b> is just the 
raw performance of the OS/2 <b>DosRead()</b> APIs without accounting for 
overhead of the comparims itself (for the CD-ROM drive that gives you
a good hint about the raw performance of your CD-ROM drive, e.g. if you
have a 32x drive and use factory mastered medias, you should get near to a
32x speed).
The Total performance does include all overhead, that is the timer is started
when the files are opened and stopped when they have been compared.
Thus, don't take the performance specified too serious!
<p>
ISOCOMP/2 is a multithreaded application, that is the <b>Source</b> and
<b>Target</b> file are read by different threads concurrently to speed up
performance.
As usually you won't compare an ISO image from the contents of a CD-ROM drive 
with the image stored as a file on the same drive (if you could do that, you
might already be within the singularity of a black hole ;-) this is a default 
option, however you can force ISOCOMP/2 to use only 1 thread by the </!MP> 
commandline option.
<p>
You may also notice that you may have a different buffer size.
This is normal, because ISOCOMP/2 takes the amount of physical memory into
account to be efficient on one hand and to limit swapping on the other hand.
Using the option <b>/TINY</b> ISOCOMP/2 will use 2 64kB buffers instead of a
percentage of the RAM installed.
This might be useful if you are running a memory constraint system (or a last
resort on buggy drivers, that can't partition the buffer in multiple 64kB
DMA requests).
<p>
Finally, to ensure that you can notice the progress, a percentage indicator,
and if required a retry counter, will be displayed while comparing ISO images 
that are larger than the given buffer size.
<p>
When comparing using CD, CD-R or CR-RW media (increasing probability in
this sequence), you may get alarmed by miscompares which disappear 
during one of the retries or when running ISOCOMP/2 once again.
I'm not sure what causes that, but from my experience I suspect that misreads 
of the drive (e.g. weak bits) occurred (when thinking about the requirements
of the hardware regarding the exact timing and positioning of the head for writing
one bit, increased by the use of some media like e.g. 700 MB CD-R/CD-RWs,
800 MB CD-Rs and high-speed CD-RWs, on surfaces that are indeed sensitive 
to scratches, to I'm not really surprised.
Reading the same files again may just cause different read results due to the
drive's head repositioning in a different way, ISOCOMP/2 does reposition the
head automatically during its retries, to ensure best results.
You may also get different results for different drives, as a rule of thumb
I thing the more modern a drive, the lesser the number of problems you'll get.

As no Target is specified, ISOCOMP/2 knows that you're only interested in the
calculation or the CRC32 and MD5 checksums.
The checksum is made of the ISO image only, even if you had specified a RSJ
track image file (in other words the RSJ header is not part of the checksums).
<br>
If you have downloaded an ISO image from the Internet and the checksums were
also given there, you could verify that your download had no bit errors 
(though for both FTP and writing the file onto media this is very unlikely,
you can be sure).

ISOCOMP/2 allows you also to write an RSJ track image file out of an ISO image

<p>
If you found any problem or have a suggestion, please don't hesitate to tell me.
<p>
<h2>A few words about ISO images</h2>
<p>
An ISO image is just the datastream in a single file that makes up the
contents of a CD-ROM session from the beginning to the end.
An ISO image thus is a way to save and/or transmit the contents of a CD-ROM without
any data loss.
In contrast to that, you could create of course another CD-ROM out of the files
contained on a CD-ROM, but that way you may miss probably some information of the
original CD-ROM (e.g. the capability to boot, or some information MS
supposedidly has written on their Windows XP CD-ROMs to track warez copies).
<p>
If you have only an ISO image (e.g. downloading an ISO image is the way IBM has 
made available the Aurora and Merlin Convenience Pack 2 CD-ROMs to its employees
a few weeks before the official release via Software Choice - thanks at this
place for that service!),
you can't be easily sure that the contents of the CD-ROMs you've burnt are really
exactly the same as the source ISO image.
That was the motivation for me (and my experience of having burnt CD-ROMs that
contained errors) to write ISOCOMP/2 (in fact comparing the newly burnt CD-Rs
of ACP2/MCP2 with the ISO image files downloaded was the first productive
use of an ISOCOMP/2 prototype).
<p>
One way to compare the file contents of a burnt CD-ROM with the original ISO image is
using Linux and the <b>loopback device</b> to mount the ISO image as a filesystem, and
then using normal filesystem tools to do the comparison.
Similar tools also exist for Windows.
<p>
Under OS/2 you could use the <b>ISO image</b> and <b>RSJ track image</b> plugins from
<b>NetDrive</b> (available e.g. on <a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/">Hobbes</a>) to mount the 
ISO image (or RSJ track image) file as a filesystem, and then use e.g. XCOMP/2 to do 
the comparison of the file contents.
<p>
Again, both methods only allow you to ensure that the file contents are equivalent,
but not information that is stored on a CD-ROM outside the filesystem!
ISOCOMP/2 allows you to compare everything, on success you can be sure to have a
1:1 copy!
<p>
<h2>A few words about RAW images</h2>
<p>
A RAW image consists of an ISO image enhanced by data that is usually filled in by
the CD-Recorder during recording.
A RAW sector looks like:
</font>
<xmp>
    [12 bytes Sync][4 bytes Header][2048 bytes ISO sector][288 bytes EDC/ECC]
</xmp>
<font Face="Helv,Helvetica,Arial">
<p>
As you can see, a RAW sector can be converted into an ISO sector and vice versa,
though ISOCOMP/2 only supports the direction RAW to ISO (as I don't know how
the Sync and EDC/ECC is calculated and I'm not sure if supporting that would make
sense at all).
<p>
You likely will encounter RAW image files, if the image you'll burn should be an
exact copy of the original one, because if the CD-Recorder does not calculate the
EDC/ECC data itself, it will even burn errors (which may be used as a copy
protection measure).
You'll likely find CD images in RAW format in the alt.binaries.warez.*
newsgroups.
<p>
Under OS/2 you write RAW image files with <b>CDRDAO</b>, which is also available
on <a href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/">Hobbes</a>.
<p>
<h2>ISOCOMP/2 limitations</h2>
<p>
As I haven't yet found a (free) source for the specification of data CD-ROMs, that
is the ISO 9660 specification, ISOCOMP/2 relies that the format and behaviour for
data ISO image files is consistent to what I've seen in my own environment.
However, <b>some of my assumptions may be wrong</b>!
<p>
Basically, I assume, that:
<ul>
<li>only data CD-ROMs are usuable for ISOCOMP/2
<li>a data sector of a data CD-ROM always is exactly 2048 bytes in size.
<li>the size of an <b>ISO image file</b> is an exact multiple of 2048 bytes.
<li>the size of an <b>RAW image file</b> is an exact multiple of 2352 bytes,
and only the ISO contents will be used then.
<li>the contents of an ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file were exactly burnt onto 
a CD-R/CD-RW, regardsless what program has been used. 
<li>a <b>RAW image file</b> either has the extension <b>*.RAW</b> or <b>*.BIN</b> or
is a multiple of 2352 bytes and not fractionless divisible by 2048
<li>a <b>RSJ track image file</b> is a normal ISO image file that is prefixed
by a exactly 40 bytes sized RSJ header.
The current 3.xx version of RSJ behaves that way, but as this is not documented
officially AFAIK, there is no guarantee that it will forever that way.
<li>a RSJ track image has the extension <b>*.TRK</b> or <b>*.RSJ</b> and/or
contains the contents usually seen in an RSJ header.
<li>an ISO image consists of all sectors one can read from a CD-ROM burnt
(regardless what program has been used) out of it and vice versa.
<br>
That is, if the ISO image file is 31415 sectors in size, then also exactly 
31415 sectors are expected to be readable on the CD-ROM media (using the OS/2 APIs).
The ISO image file size must be 64337920 that is 31415*2048.
</ul>
<p>
If you know some additional information about ISO images and want to share
it or want me to enhance ISOCOMP/2, you're welcome to
<a href="mailto:Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com">e-mail me</a>!
<p>
<h2>What's new</h2>
<p>
The following items have changed between V1.20 and its predecessor 1.10:
<ul>
<li>Added the support to read the ISO contents of RAW image files, so you can
compare the contents of a CD burnt with the RAW image file it was burnt from
(though as said only the ISO contents).
</ul>
<p>
The following items have changed between V1.10 and its predecessor 1.00:
<ul>
<li>Fixed that ISOCOMP/2 displayed an error when creating an ISO image
or RSJ track image file.
<li>Added support for RSJ's CDWFS, but that didn't work as a drive attached
by RSJ can't be opened in DASD (Direct Access Storage Device) mode (most
likely because RSJ drives are attached like network drives).
Unfortunately that means I have to remove that support again (but you
still can use CDRecord's READCD.EXE to dump a media directly using SCBs
(SCSI Control Blocks)). 
<li>Added the option <b>/P</b> to pause ISOCOMP/2 on exit.
<li>Added a dump of possible memory leaks when compiled in Debug mode.
<li>Changed the stack size from 64kB to 512kB to avoid possible (but
very unlikely) stack shortages.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>CRC32 and MD5 checksum logic</h2>
<p>
The calculation of CRC32 and MD5 checksums is based on what that seems to be
the standard algorithm used on the Internet.
As I'm certainly not an expert in cryptology, and thus can't tell how good 
the quality of the CRC32 and MD5 checksums is (AFAIK it's rather good) , I
used the sample codes I found on the Internet after a little searching
as a starting point.
<p>
The CRC32 implementation I dereived from some freely available sample codes, 
the MD implementation is derived from the <b>RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5 Message-Digest 
Algorithm</b> sample implementation, which is also freely available if above 
identification is included on materials based on it.
