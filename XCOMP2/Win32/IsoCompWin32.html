<h2>ISOCOMP/2 on WIN32</h2>
<p>
As far as I can tell, IsoComp/2 for WIN32 should behave the same between OS/2 and WIN32,
though due to the different APIs there, there might be incompatibilities I'm
certainly interested in hearing about.
<p>
I did the port under NT4 SP5, and though I was using the oldest version of
the APIs some APIs are not available on WIN9x so it won't work there.
As always, Microsoft's inflation of APIs for different versions of Windows
is a hell, and shows that due to their monopoly they can force what they want,
and whatever they do looks shortsighted!

ISOCOMP/2 - The ISO image file compare utility for OS/2 (WIN32 port), V1.20

            (C) Roman Stangl 05, 2002 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)

Use the ISOCOMP command to compare the contents of a Source CD-ROM with the
contents of a Target CD-ROM or with an ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file.
Or you can create an ISO image or RSJ track image file out of a CD-ROM.

Syntax:
  ISOCOMP Source(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
        Target(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
        [/!MP] [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]] [/P] [/TINY]
        [/CHK:drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
  ISOCOMP CDROM-drive: | CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file
        [/!MP] [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]] [/P] [/TINY]
        [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
Where:
  Source(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
                 Specifies either the Source drive letter (e.g. Z or Z:) of
                 your CD-ROM drive containing a data CD-ROM, or the location
                 and name of a Source ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file, whose
                 contents you want to compare with a media in your Target
                 CD-ROM drive or to compare it with or write from an ISO image
                 or RSJ track image file.
                 You may specify a fully qualified path or UNC path.
  Target(CDROM-drive:|[drive:\|\\server\][path\]ISO|RAW-file)
                 Specifies either the Target drive letter (e.g. Z or Z:) of
                 your CD-ROM drive containing a data CD-ROM, or the location
                 and name of a Target ISO, RAW or RSJ track image file. If
                 the image file does not exist, it will be created out of the
                 CD-ROM contents, otherwise compared with the CD-ROM contents
                 (Only ISO or RSJ track image files will be created).
                 You may specify a fully qualified path or UNC path.
  [/!MP]
                 Specifies that only 1 thread is used reading the CD-ROM
                 contents and the image file instead of the default of 2
                 threads.
  [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]]
                 Specifies that ISOCOMP/2 logs all problems into a file
                 specified either by this parameter, or by the ISOCOMP
                 environment variable or into ISOCOMP.LOG (put into the
                 directory ISOCOMP/2 was installed into) otherwise.
  [/P]
                 Request ISOCOMP/2 to pause when it has finished.
  [/TINY]
                 2 64kB buffers are used instead of a percentage of total RAM.
  [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
                 Specifies that ISOCOMP/2 uses a checksum file to ensure data
                 integrity. If the checksum file does not exist, it will be
                 created, otherwise compared with the checksum calculated
                 from the data read from the Source.
Returns:
  0              Successful completion
  100+           Fatal, unrecoverable exceptions

<h2>Accessing IsoComp/2 for WIN32</h2>
<p>
The port IsoComp/2 to windows is part of the 
<a href="../XComp.html#XCOMP/2 source code">XComp/2 source code</a> archive, both
for the modified source code and the exectuable itself.
<p>
Note: <font color="Red">You have to have access to an OS/2 PC to decrypt the 
encrypted source code archive, because I provide the decryption executable only for OS/2.
These tools are for OS/2 users who are forced to used Windows sometimes, but
not for users that uncritically help to extend the power of the evil's empire 
monopoly!</font>
