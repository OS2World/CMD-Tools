<h2>XCOMP/2 on WIN32</h2>
<p>
As far as I can tell, XComp/2 for WIN32 should behave the same between OS/2 and WIN32,
though due to the different APIs there, there might be incompatibilities I'm
certainly interested in hearing about.
<p>
I did the port under NT4 SP5, and though I was using the oldest version of
the APIs that should be available under WIN9x too, there is no guarantee 
that XComp/2 will really work there.
As always, Microsoft's inflation of APIs for different versions of Windows
is a hell, and shows that due to their monopoly they can force what they want,
and whatever they do looks shortsighted!
<p>
The only visible difference is the logo displayed when invoking XComp/2:

XCOMP/2 - The recursive file compare utility for OS/2 (WIN32 port), V3.10

          (C) Roman Stangl 05, 2002 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)
          http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/7885/

Use the XCOMP command to selectively compare groups of files located in two
directories, including all subdirectories.

Syntax:
  XCOMP [drive:\|\\server\][path\]filename(s) [[drive:\|\\server\]path] [/!MP]
        [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]] [/!C] [/!F] [/!S] [/!B] [/P]
        [/TINY] [/LINE] [/SIMULATE] [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
Where:
  [drive:\|\\server\][path\]filename(s)
                 Specifies the location and name of the Source file(s) to
                 compare from. You may specify a fully qualified path or
                 UNC path.
  [[drive:\|\\server\]path]
                 Specifies the location of the Target path to compare with.
                 You may specify a fully qualified path or UNC path.
  [/MP]
                 Specifies that 1 thread reads the source and 1 thread reads
                 the target file. This improves througput when comparing from 2
                 different physical drives (e.g. CD-ROM and Harddisk).
  [/LOG[:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]]
                 Specifies that XCOMP/2 logs all problems into a file specified
                 either by this parameter, or by the XCOMP environment variable
                 or into XCOMP.LOG (put into the directory XCOMP/2 was
                 installed into) otherwise.
  [/!C]
                 By default, XCOMP/2 pauses at all mismatches. Specifying this
                 option allows XCOMP/2 just display the mismatch and continue
                 the comparison without a pause (e.g. useful when using the
                 /LOG option or output redirection).
  [/!F]
                 By default, XCOMP/2 pauses for files in the source location
                 that can't be found at the target location. Specifying this
                 this option allows XCOMP/2 just display the miss and continue
                 the comparison without a pause (e.g. useful when using the
                 /LOG option or output redirection).
  [/!S]
                 By default, XCOMP/2 recurses into all subdirectories it finds,
                 specifying this option prevents XCOMP/2 doing that.
  [/!B]
                 By default, XCOMP/2 will beep, when a severe error occurs
                 accessing a file at the source or target location. Specifying
                 this option will silence XCOMP/2 (e.g. useful when using the
                 /LOG option or output redirection).
  [/P]
                 Request XCOMP/2 to pause when it has finished.
  [/TINY]
                 2 64kB buffers are used instead of a percentage of total RAM.
  [/LINE]
                 Display line number information for messages (useful for e.g.
                 debugging)
  [/SIMULATE]
                 Does not compare the files (useful for e.g. just to list what
                 files would be compared by checking their existance)
  [/CHK:[drive:\|\\server\][path\]file]
                 Specifies that XCOMP/2 uses a checksum file to ensure data
                 integrity. If the checksum file does not exist, it will be
                 created, otherwise compared with the checksum calculated
                 from the data read from the Source.
                 When using the extension ".MD5" is used, the checksum file
                 will be compatible to the MD5SUM utility. You may need the
                 option /!S additionally, as MD5SUM ignores subdirectories.
Returns:
  0              Successful completion
  1              Files could not be opened to compare (possibly 0-length,
                 locked or not existing)
  2              Directories could not be opened to search for files (possibly
                 access right or file system problems)
  3              Directories could not be opened to search for directories
                 possibly access right or file system problems)
  4              A mismatch between at least 1 file was detected
  5              A mismatch between the calculated Checksum and the recorded
                 one in the Checksum file of at least 1 file was detected
  100+           Fatal, unrecoverable exceptions

<h2>Porting to WIN32</h2>
<p>
Because I was in a <em>masochisitic</em> mood, I started to port the OS/2 code to the
WIN32 platform (done under NT4, but I would not know why the port shouldn't work under
the gaming OS's WIN95 and above too).
After about 12 hours or so (without having done anything specific for the WIN32
API before) the <em>horror</em> was over and the port seems to be working.
<p>As I almost expected, it really was some kind of horror adventure even though
I also used IBM's VisualAge C++ compiler so that at least the non-OS/2 C++ stuff
shouldn't cause headaches.
Anyway, after that experience I am reconfirmed that it is a pleasure to develop
under OS/2 compared to WIN32, because:
<ul>
<li>The MS SDK (admittedly the one included in IBM's compiler is definitely
dated now, the documentation you can download from MS directly is much better,
though I don't know how well it is usable with IBM's compiler) is horrible 
compared to the OS/2 Warp toolkit:
<ul>
<li>The contents of the single 20 MB sized Windows Helpfile are a bad joke,
it is incomplete, messed up, a mentally-ill hierachical structure,
usually non-helpful and a plague to read.
<li>Searching the help is a bad joke at best, unless you exactly know what you're
looking for.
<li>Even if you found something, you have to wonder what parameters are
used as input and output.
<li>Many help hyperlinks just point into the woods.
<li>The C include files seem to have been written in a non-consistent style,
searching there instead of the help file is also troublesome.
<li>I may not have figured out it correctly, but just using
<em>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</em> instead of including only the header
files needed by using <em>#define INCL_*</em> as under OS/2, slows down
compilition enormously as the C-preprocessor has to look through myriads
of headerfiles.
</ul>
<li>The debugger included with VisualAge C++ looks similar to OS/2's
<em>IPMD</em>, <em>ICSDEBUG</em> and <em>IDEBUG</em> but:
<ul>
<li>Does not work unter W2K, for W2K one can download freely
from IBM the <em>IDEBUG</em> debugger (thanks), which is a remote
debugger (thus allowing you to debug not just locally, but also
remotely over a TCP/IP network), but has a relatively slow (on
a 866 MHz PIII) JAVA frontend that admittedly looks quite magnificent,
but clearly lacks the flexibility of the older native debugger
(e.g. to freely position and overlap all windows) thus once you need
to look at more than 4 things you'll get crazy.
<li>The <em>IDEBUG</em> debugger comes as a 60MB
<em>bloatware</em> download, sucking up to 240MB (!) on your disk.
<li>I'm not sure if it is related to Windows or just to the Debugger,
but when using the default settings it won't catch access violations
and just ends the failing application.
By requesting it to watch for access violations, it stops at
various points even in a working program.
I could explain that by Windows demand-loading pages that way,
but even if it's not that silly as it looks like, it's damned
useless for debugging.
<li>I have to admit though, that it did not crash (as the OS/2
version sometimes does) and even if it did, it easily can be
closed from Task Manager.
<li>Also, but that's a consequence that NT has multiple input queues
in contrast to OS/2's single input queue, it does not lock up the
desktop even when debugging GUI programs.
</ul>
<li>The WIN32 API:
<ul>
<li>Similar to the header files, it's non-consistent.
For some APIs one can rely that the value returned tells if the call
was ok or has failed, more often one has to explicitely ask for
the error code by <em>GetLastError()</em>, which returns the last
error even if it was set by a call long before (thus, one has
to use <em>SetLastError()</em> to avoid that and bloat the code).
Unless you get used of that you hunt down phantom errors excessively.
<li>The APIs themselfes are difficult to oversee, as there is no
hint where they come from.
In contrast under OS/2 where e.g. the base API is prefixed by <em>Dos</em>
or the GUI API by <em>Win</em>, which makes is much more logical
to read and understand.
<li>Of course, it's heavily non-consistent that some APIs return
the result in the result code while others return it via a
(pointer to the passed) parameter.
</ul>
<li>The IBM VisualAge C++ 3.6 FP2 compiler:
<ul>
<li>The main advantage is that it is quite compatible with the OS/2
version, so you can concentrate on the program not the environment itself.
<li>The debugger is still the best I've seen under Windows, unfortunately
IBM messed that up too, because their latest Windows debugger (using a
JAVA frontend) is a real Microsoft look-alike application, a much nicer
GUI but having an idiotic when it comes to a real productive use.
<li>I can't be installed on anything later than NT (while using an installed
setup will still work except the debugger as I said above).
Unfortunately, IBM gave up in the C/C++ compiler market (ok, not completely, 
AIX is the last platform supported, probably because they don't get kicked out
by the MS marketing machine there, but as IBM no longer likes OS/2 and they
saw they don't have a chance on MS's homeland they left the Intel platform
completely).
</ul>
<li>Finally, the editor:
<ul>
<li>Under OS/2 I use EPM and I haven't yet seen anything better on
any platform, using <em>WRITE</em> or <em>WORDPAD</em> can only be
a temporary solution as without linenumber information one is lost
when programming.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
Well, meanwhile I had the chance to play a little with MS VisualStudio
C++ 6, and of course some observations:
<ul>
<li>It's a IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in the deepest sense
of it's word, I yet have to see if there is a way to run the compiler from
a commandline.
<li>While I admit this environment seems powerful enough to do all 
programming project one might think of in the IDE, it has a bad habit to
write lots of proprietary files and lots of directories.
E.g. even for a simple "Hello World!" you get multiple files beside the
main C file, be it one for precompiled headers, be it for a class browser,
be it what only the devil knows.
And it also creates multiple directories for building a debug and an
optimized version.
<li>The GUI looks nice, but it's always the same with such Mickey Soft
applications, real productive use is hard.
Take e.g. the debugger (which is similar to IBM's latest JAVA based
incarnation of its debugger), it is simply uncapable of displaying lots
of variable monitor, be it because that window can't be detached from the
integrated environment to be sized to any size more usuable, be it that the
nice layout takes so much space on the screen that there is not much space
left to display the variable monitor.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
Once again, it's clearly to demonstrate that OS/2 is the superior
platform and one gets only even more disappointed that IBM lost
interest to compete with that inferior monopolistic evil empire
(it won't bring back OS/2, but one can at least hope that
switching to Windows makes things much more expensive, unreliable
and insecure, so we got at least something to laugh about).
<p>
I haven't really looked into LINUX programming, but have bought the
book <em>Linux Application Development</em> because it was heavily
recommended everywhere.
After reading it I really was very disappointed (or maybe I did
not understand what this book was written for), because it did
spent a lot of time talking about terminals and so, but not or
just on the surface talking about queues, semaphores, multithreading,
... all the stuff needed to make good programs :-(.
<p>
<h2>The SYS executable</h2>
<p>
During XComp/2 porting on WIN32 I had to struggle with API return codes
as many APIs provide the same as OS/2 (even the macro reads the same)
while others provide different (it seems to me that OS/2 has a finer
resolution when providing error codes) return codes.
As translating the return codes into something one can find out its
cause, I have written <b>Sys.c</b> which returns the text corresponding
to the return code (as the MS SDK help proved helpless and the header
files are too incomplete again).
<p>
It's similar what you can receive under OS/2 when typing <b>HELP SYSx</b>
where <b>x</b> is the return code, except that under OS/2 you also get
some information how to cure the problem.
Just type <b>SYS</b> to get some basic help:

SYS - Windows error code retriever for WIN32, V1.00

      (C) Roman Stangl 09, 2001 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)
      http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/7885/

Syntax: SYS x
Where:      x ... Numeric Windows system error code
</xmp>
<font Face="Helv,Helvetica,Arial">
Or type <b>SYS x</b> where <b>x</b> is the API return code, e.g.
<b>32</b>:
</font>
<xmp>
SYS32: The process cannot access the file because
it is being used by another process.
</xmp>
<font Face="Helv,Helvetica,Arial">
<p>
By the way, this utility can also be helpful when XComp/2 does complain
and show error codes during comparison to find out the cause (e.g.
XComp/2 will just tell <b>SYS32</b> when you try to compare <b>PAGEFILE.SYS</b>,
because the Windows swapper is locked by the system as <b>SYS 32</b>
will tell you).
<p>
<h2>Accessing XComp/2 for WIN32</h2>
<p>
The port XComp/2 to windows is part of the 
<a href="../XComp.html#XCOMP/2 source code">XComp/2 source code</a> archive, both
for the modified source code and the exectuable itself.
<p>
Note: <font color="Red">You have to have access to an OS/2 PC to decrypt the 
encrypted source code archive, because I provide the decryption executable only for OS/2.
These tools are for OS/2 users who are forced to used Windows sometimes, but
not for users that uncritically help to extend the power of the evil's empire 
monopoly!</font>
