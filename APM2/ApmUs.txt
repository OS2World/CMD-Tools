; Note: Translation just needs to begin with message 3, messages 0 to 2

APM/2 V1.40 - Advanced Power Management spec. 1.1/1.2 interface for OS/2

APM0004I: X APM/2 allows you to put your workstation into APM standby, suspend or power off
mode,  to turn your PC on with the automatic  APM power on timer and to restore
to the pre-APM request state.  Requests  can/must  be scheduled with a built-in
scheduler. The sourcecode includes a C/C++ Toolkit for you to make your own APM
OS/2 applications.

This program is Freeware (and can be freely distributed, as long as the archive
is kept complete), however you must not port it to  any of the inferior Windows
platforms!

          device driver  could be opened successfully, this is either a program
          error,  or in case  that the error was a  SYS0087  there seem to be a

APM0052E: E Invalid  combination of "Request"  /Poweron and  "Schedule" detected.
          /Poweron requires a "Schedule" of when that event should occur.

APM0054I: I Planned event occurred.

APM0055E: E OS/2 error SYS$$04d reading the System clock.

APM0056E: E The "Request"  /Poweron requires  APM support at version 1.2 or above
          for which  you need your  APM BIOS at  version 1.2+ and  version 1.2+
          of OS/2's APM.SYS driver. The later can be obtained from IBM's online
          Device Driver site or  Warp 4 Fixpack 6+.  You can use the  "Request"
          /Verbose to show your APM levels,  however you can deactivate version
          checking by supplying the parameter /Force.

APM0057E: E The "Request"  /Poweroff, /Poweroff- oder /Poweroff+  requires Warp 4
          because otherwise a  CHKDSK will be performed during the  next reboot
          as the filesystem won't be closed correctly, if the request processes
          successfully  at all.  However you can dactivate  version checking by
          supplying the parameter /Force.

          BIOS to the latest level.
