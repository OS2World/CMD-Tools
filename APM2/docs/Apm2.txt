Dear User!

For a English and German description of APM/2 please take a look into the file
READ.ME. Alternatively you may browse the English APM2.HTML document.

Change history:

1.30:   *) APM/2 now includes a APM.SYS version 1.2 conforming toolkit that 
           allows you to write your own APM applications.
        *) APM/2 allows you to restore the pre-APM request state with /Ready
        *) APM/2 configuration option (/Verbose) enhanced
        *) APM/2 now displays possible errors more accurately
        *) APM/2 now supports the APM 1.2 automatic power on timer
        *) APM/2 now allows you to schedule APM requests
        *) APM/2 now NLS enabled by just creating a APMxx.txt/APMxx.msg file

1.40:   *) Fixed that message at line 424 was displayed without having been
           completed by the required parameter (DosDevIOCtl() return code).
        *) Fixed that when running on a non Us or Gr installation that each
           message got prefixed by a message stating that the NLS message
           could not be found and the Us one is taken instead.
           Now, if no /Language option is specified, the Us messagefile is
           taken silently when no NLS messagefile was found, if /Language
           was specified but the file doesn't exist, a single message informs
           the user about that and that from now on the Us one will be taken.
        *) Fixed minor spelling and layout mistakes in English and German
           message files.
        *) Added Russian NLS messages, thanks very much to Andres Phillippov
           for the translation.

Have fun! Roman
