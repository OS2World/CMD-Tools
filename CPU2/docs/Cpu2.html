<h1>The CPU Utility/2 home page</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the home of <em>CPU Utility/2</em> or shorter just <em>CPU/2</em>, a 
Freeware utility that allows you either to toggle processors on your OS/2 SMP workstation
from Online to Offline (and vice versa) or to display the relative CPU utilization for the busy,
idle and interrupt states per CPU on your OS/2 Warp Server Adv. SMP, Warp 4 
and Warp Server for e-Business (WSeB, Aurora) (and likely Warp 3
with some recent fixpacks) workstations.
<h2>News</h2>
<em>CPU/2</em> has been updated to version 1.10. It will now display the correct
values under Warp Server for e-Business (WSeB, Aurora).
Special thanks to Scott E. Garfinkle (seg) for telling me how to initialize the
performance counters correctly (that info is just missing in the Warp Toolkit
V4.5). 
<h2>Description of CPU/2</h2>
If you have installed OS/2 Warp Server Advanced SMP, then you likely have noticed
that it includes the <em>MPCPUMON</em> utility, which allows you to toggle your
processors from Online to Offline (and vice versa) and displays a CPU utilization
graph, which gives you per processor information about how busy (ranging from 0 to
100 percent) your PC is.
<p>
I wrote CPU/2, because:
<ul>
<li>I was interested in the OS/2 APIs required to make such a program
<li>MPCPUMON is a PM program and thus can't be run in a batch job or from a remote
telnet session
<li>the CPU utilitzation shows very often unexplainable "spikes" even on an idle 
running system
<li>the CPU utilization measurement logic could now easily be added to a Windows NT
look-alike Task Manager
</ul>
<p>When invoking <em>XCOMP</em> without commandline arguments, the help
is displayed:

CPU/2 V1.10 - UP and MP CPU Utility/2 for OS/2
Copyright (C) by Roman Stangl, 1998, 2000 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)
                 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/7885/

CPU/2 allows you to query or  setting the processor status  on supported single
(UP ... uniprocessor)  or  multiprocessor (MP ... multiprocessor)  systems.  It
also  allows  you to measure  the processor  utilitzation  for  both  UP and MP
configurations.

This program is Freeware (and can be freely distributed, as long as the archive
is kept complete), however you must not port it to  any of the inferior Windows
platforms!

CPU0005I: Insufficient commandline options specified.

Syntax: CPU /?
Where:  /? ... display help

Returns:
        0 .... Successful completion
        1+ ... Fatal, unrecoverable exception

</xmp>
The return code is the nummeric value of the exception for which CPU/2 has displayed
and error message CPUxxxxy (where xxxx is the return code and y is the type of the
exception, which includes <em>I</em>nformational and <em>E</em>rror messages).
<p>
CPU/2 will display information about its required and optional parameters when you
invoke <em>CPU /?</em>.

CPU/2 V1.10 - UP and MP CPU Utility/2 for OS/2
Copyright (C) by Roman Stangl, 1998, 2000 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)
                 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/7885/

CPU0006I: Commandline options:

Syntax: CPU Request [Language]

Where:  Request  ... /Verbose     to query the processor status
                 ... /Online x    to set processor number x to online status
                 ... /Offline x   to set processor number x to offline status
                 ... /Performance to activate Performance measurements

        Language ... /Language xx to display NLS messages out of CPUxx.msg
                                  (e.g. GR for German)

</xmp>
CPU/2 determines your country's language from the <em>COUNTRY=xx</em> statement in your
<em>CONFIG.SYS</em>. 
If there exists no <em>CPUxx.msg</em> file in the directory CPU/2 was installed into 
where <em>xx</em> is the parameter from the <em>COUNTRY</em> statement, CPU/2 will
default to the US english messages.
However, if either the language detection is not supported for your country or you want
to see messages in a certain language, you can, by using the <em>/Language xx</em>
parameter, force CPU/2 to use a certain language (which of course will display and error
message and return to US english, if no corresponding <em>CPUxx.msg</em> is found).
<p>
APM/2 is provided in 2 NLS versions:
<ul>
<li>APM.EXE with APMUs.msg (English version)
<li>APM.EXE with APMGr.msg (German version)
</ul>
You can easily create your own (SBCS single byte character set) national language
version, just use CPUUs.txt as a template, translate the messages there without
altering the row and column layout, indentions, characters per line, ... and 
compile it with the MKMSGF compiler from the Toolkit (or send me the file and
I'll try to compile it).
<br>
If someone volunteers to create a national language version, I'm prepared to
add it to my site and the package (surely you will be credited too ;-).
<h2>Using CPU/2</h2>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>/Verbose</td>
    <td>This option displays the current status of your processor(s). Currently to use
        that option successfully, you need to be running Warp Server Advanced SMP, but
        future OS/2 versions likely will support the required APIs too.</td>
<tr><td>/Online x<br>
        /Offline x</td>
    <td>This option allows you to toggle a processor from Online to Offline status or
        vice versa. CPU/2 verifies that your request has been performed correctly by
        verbosing and comparing the new processor status with the requested one.
        Again, currently that request will only work on Warp Server Advanced SMP.<br>
        One thing to mention is that processor 1 of an SMP system can't be set to 
        Offline (though the term "symmetrical" from SMP would imply that) I'm afraid 
        the current Intel based multiprocessor specification APIC 1.4 defines CPU 1 
        as a special one which must run in order for the whole PC to run (I suppose 
        that this is the only CPU that can process certain hardware interrupts).</td>.
<tr><td>/Performance</td>
    <td>This options verboses the relative CPU utilization per processor for the categories
        Idle, Busy and Interrupt every second until the Space Bar is pressed:
        <xmp>
        In the format of: CPU x ( aa/ bb/ cc), where
        
        x    ... Processor (x)
        Idle ... Amount of Idle-time (aa)
        Busy ... Amount of Busy-time (bb)
        Intr ... Amount of Interrupt-time (cc)
        
        CPU 1 (  0/ 99/  1) CPU 2 (  0/100/  0)
        </xmp>
        In above example, I was running the RC5 cracking client so there is no Idle time,
        both CPUs are flat out, just CPU 1 was also spending some time in Interrupt
        processing (I have never seen and Interrupt processing time for CPU 2, that's why
        I suppose CPU 1 can't be set to Offline, even MPCPUMON can't, by specifying
        the option /APIC on OS2APIC.PSD I would expect symmetrical interrupt processing
        on all CPUs).
        <br>
        For each CPU found in your system, this information will be displayed, however
        only 4 will fit into a "normal" 80 columns wide commandline. As the status will
        be updated every second on the same line, 5 of more CPUs will cause an additional
        linefeed in between and the output formatting will be corrupted a little bit.
        (You can use "MODE 132,25" as a workaround though.)
        <br>
        To prevent that short-lived temporary <em>spikes</em> (as one can see in MPCPUMON)
        will be reported, an average of the last measurements (currently 5) is calculated
        and displayed. This filters such spikes and causes a much smoother display.
        <br>
        On final thing to note is, that this option will also work on Warp 4 and likely
        also Warp 3 systems (with some recent fixpacks applied), of course it will only
        show data for 1 CPU, as those OS/2 versions will ignore any CPU installed except
        CPU 1.
</td>
<tr><td>/Language xx</td>
    <td>This option allows you to force using the national language version of CPU/2 where
        <b>CPUxx.msg</b> exists. CPU/2 ships with CPUUs.msg and CPUGr.msg, being the
        English and German NLS versions.<br>
        CPU/2 tries to load messages in the language of the system where it is running
        on, e.g. on a German setup (049 at the COUNTRY statement in CONFIG.SYS) the
        German message file is used, though those automatic support is limited to
        only major languages.<br>
        You can easily use CPUUs.txt as a template, translate the messages while preserving
        the row and column layout, and then compile them into your national language
        CPUxx.msg messagefile. As said, if you're running a major language as e.g. French
        or Spanish, NLS support will be used automatically then, otherwise just supply
        the <b>/Language xx</b> option.</td>
