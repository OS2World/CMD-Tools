; CPUxx.txt    NLS messages file, to support another language create
;              a copy of this file containing translated messages and
;              replace xx (for example) by:
;                  Us ... for US English
;                  Gr ... for German
;                  Fr ... for French
;              And then run the application with the commandline option
;              -Language Gr (for German,...). 
;
; Note: Translation just needs to begin with message 3, messages 0 to 2
;       are reserved
;
; Note: The formatting done here is reflected in the actual output of
;       the message, so I recommend to keep empty lines and the column
;       width (just keep the shipped message source file as a template)

CPU0001I: I The NLS messagefile %s does not exist.
          Please correct that problem,  for now the English messagefile will be
          used instead!

CPU/2 V1.10 - UP and MP CPU Utility/2 for OS/2
Copyright (C) by Roman Stangl, 1998, 2000 (Roman_Stangl@at.ibm.com)
                 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Pines/7885/

CPU0004I: X CPU/2 allows you to query or  setting the processor status  on supported single
(UP ... uniprocessor)  or  multiprocessor (MP ... multiprocessor)  systems.  It
also  allows  you to measure  the processor  utilitzation  for  both  UP and MP
configurations.

This program is Freeware (and can be freely distributed, as long as the archive
is kept complete), however you must not port it to  any of the inferior Windows
platforms!

CPU0005I: I Insufficient commandline options specified.

Syntax: CPU /?
Where:  /? ... display help

Returns:
        0 .... Successful completion
        1+ ... Fatal, unrecoverable exception

CPU0006I: I Commandline options:

CPU0007I: X Syntax: CPU Request [Language]

Where:  Request  ... /Verbose     to query the processor status
                 ... /Online x    to set processor number x to online status
                 ... /Offline x   to set processor number x to offline status
                 ... /Performance to activate Performance measurements

        Language ... /Language xx to display NLS messages out of CPUxx.msg
                                  (e.g. GR for German)

CPU0008E: E Required parameter "Request" not specified or invalid.

CPU0009E: E Ambiguous parameters specified for "Request".

CPU0010E: E Error while  dynamically loading the  Processor Status  APIs.  Likely
you are using a non-SMP capable OS/2 version,  which does not export the Kernel
APIs DosGetProcessorStatus() und DosSetProcessorStatus().

Note: The options /Verbose, /Online and /Offline can't be used thus.

CPU0011E: E Error  while  dynamically  loading the  Performance Meassurement API.
Most Likely you are using a OS/2 version not supporting that function  (likely
an older version,  for which the API  DosPerfSysCall()  is not supported yet).
Applying the latest fixpack likely adds the support.

Note: The option /Performance can't be used thus.

CPU0012E: E Error querying the  number of installed processors.  Most likely  you
are using a OS/2 version not supporting that function (likely an older version,
for which the  API  DosQuerySysInfo(QSV_NUMPROCESSORS) is not yet supported).

Note: The options /Verbose, /Online and /Offline can't be used thus.

CPU0013I: I Current status of the installed processors:
CPU0014I: X           Processor $$2ld online
CPU0015I: X           Processor $$2ld offline
CPU0016I: X
CPU0017E: E Error SYS$$04d reading processor $$2ld status.

CPU0018E: E An  unexpected error occurred while reading a  processor status, this
error should not  occur as  it  would mean  that a processor's  status can't be
queried though it was detected during booting of OS/2.

CPU0019I: I Status change requested for not installed processor $$2ld. Please ensure
that  your request  stays  within  the  supported  range  from  prozessor 1  to
processor $$2ld.

CPU0020E: E Please  ensure that  parameters are within the valid ranges. A status
change for processor 1 for example is not possible!

CPU0021E: E The requested status change was not successful. Please retry it again
later.

CPU0022I: I Error $$04ld setting processor $$2ld status.

CPU0023I: I The  request for a processor  status  change  was successful, however
reading the processor status again showed no status change.

CPU0024I: I Please  press  the  Space-Bar  to  quit displaying  the relative  CPU
utilization, divided by the following items:

In the format of: CPU x ( aa/ bb/ cc), where

x    ... Processor (x)
Idle ... Amount of Idle-time (aa)
Busy ... Amount of Busy-time (bb)
Intr ... Amount of Interrupt-time (cc)
 
CPU0025I: P CPU$$2ld ($$3ld/$$3ld/$$3ld)

CPU0026I: X 

CPU performance measurement terminated due to user request.

CPU0027E: E Unexpected  error while querying  CPU utilization.  If this is a per-
sistent problem most likely it is a bug in CPU/2, if the problem appears inter-
mittendly a OS/2 Kernel bug is also imaginable.
